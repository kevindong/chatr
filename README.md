# chatr

## Description
Today, there are chatbots available for most online platforms. For a software engineer, setting up one of these chatbots seems trivial; however, for people without software development experience, importing packages from npm might as well be impossible. Setting up a bot should be easy, intuitive, and accessible to those without programming knowledge. Chatr will allow users to pick and choose what modules their bot should have via a web interface. Developers will be able to upload their own self-created modules for other users to add onto their bot.
