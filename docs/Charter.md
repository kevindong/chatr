# Chatr – Project Charter

Team 5: Michael Bilstein (@Meegul), Kevin Dong (@kevindong), Scott Mangiapane (@scottmangiapane), Jay Patel (@patel445), and Jordan Pitlor (@piticent123).

## Problem Statement

Today, there are chatbots available for most online platforms. For a software engineer, setting up one of these chatbots seems trivial; however, for people without software development experience, importing packages from npm might as well be impossible. Setting up a bot should be easy, intuitive, and accessible to those without programming knowledge. Extending the functionality of the bot with modules also shouldn’t require a bachelor's degree.

## Project Objectives

* Create an application that makes provisioning a custom Facebook Messenger chat bot very easy
* Develop a website that allows users to register and customize their services
* Have a console for developers to upload their own modules for users to use
* Produce an initial collection of modules to populate the marketplace

## Stakeholders

* Users: Any English-speaking person worldwide with a Facebook account
* Developers: Michael Bilstein, Kevin Dong, Scott Mangiapane, Jay Patel, and Jordan Pitlor
* Project Manager: Michael Bilstein
* Owners: The entire team

## Project Deliverables

* Backend for the bot coded in Node.js, hosted on Heroku
* A relational database with user registration, bot modules, and bot data
* Customizable Facebook Messenger chat bot
* Extensible modular system, with the ability for developers to include their own functionality
* Initial set of examples modules
* A website that allows a user to set up their own, custom bot without needing to write any code
